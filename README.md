# elsarticle
The elsarticle class is broken

The \LaTeX document breakselsarticle.tex arbitrarily omits Tables 1 and 2.
The sentinel \lettablesappeartrue lets the tables reappear and its negation
\lettablesappearfalse causes the tables to disappear.

I have not established any other sideeffects of *this* document but have observed
chunks of text disappearing when this style sheet is used.
